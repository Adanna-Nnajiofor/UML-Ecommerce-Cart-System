# UML E-commerce cart system

## Title:

**E-Commerce Cart System**

## Description:

The **E-Commerce Cart System** is designed to allow users to browse products, add them to a virtual shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. Users can interact with the system by viewing their cart contents, calculating the total cost of their selected items, and finalizing the purchase through payment. The system manages inventory, keeps track of user purchases, and ensures smooth transactions from the moment an item is added to the cart until the final payment is made.

This system is vital for creating seamless online shopping experiences, offering the flexibility to manage products, process orders, and provide customers with an easy-to-use interface for shopping online.
